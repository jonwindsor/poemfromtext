## Feats, Struggles, and Reflection
I am quite fond of my work's structure, particularly the generated title that often sparks additional meaning to the text. The spacing between letters on the second line was originally done by mistake, but was left due to its use in aesthetic and emphasizing emotion, and similarly to the title, interpretation. My work is not inherently original or complex, that is certain, but the combination of written text with digital formatting and randomness is interesting to look at, read, and disect. In future iterations, I hope to make the output more consistent, removing quotation marks, names, and other language that is book specific.
